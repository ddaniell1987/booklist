# Booklist-Find a Book

Hello, welcome to my Booklist project.

This single page application, is a small list of books. When the link is clicked it will take you to a secondary page that displays not only the book's title but the book's cover image, author, genre, and plot of the book as well. 

# Purpose of the Project

This project was developed by me, while I was trying to learn Javascript. It will be helpful for someone who loves reading stuff and wants to store recommended list of books or keep a list of books and their plots for me to easily access and help figure out the next book I want to read. My main goal of this project was to help me to put my knowledge of iterations to the test. 

# Tech used
The projects uses JavaScript, HTML and a little CSS. Within this Single Page Appication, I also created my own JSON file containing data in which I would be able to fetch. This project would also be able to be completed using an API such as Google Books or Goodreads in order to pull the same information from.
